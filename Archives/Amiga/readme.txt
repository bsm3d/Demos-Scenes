Here are the few (many were lost) original Amiga (executable) demos that I made and found on my hard drives, tested and working on UAE.

Note: Amiga does not use file extensions, so an Amiga executable does not have a .exe extension. Instead, this is an ADF (Amiga Disk File). Do not try to run it on Windows or any other non-Amiga system. The .dms extension is for Disk Masher System, a Floppy disk packer.

You can simply drop this ADF into the UAE Floppy Drive Emulation and run it!
