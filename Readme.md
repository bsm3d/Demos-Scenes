# BSM3D Demos Effects Collection

Benoit (BSM3D) Saint-Moulin Â© 2025

A collection of classic Amiga demo scene effects recreated using pure HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. These demos are created for learning purposes and to pay tribute to the golden age of demo making.

## Overview

This repository contains recreations of iconic demo scene effects from the Amiga era, implemented using modern web technologies. Each effect is self-contained in a single HTML file, making it easy to understand and learn from.

## Features

* Pure HTML5 Canvas rendering
* Vanilla JavaScript - no external libraries
* Minimal CSS for styling
* Responsive design
* Pixel-perfect rendering where appropriate
* Commented code for educational purposes

## Technology Stack

* HTML5 Canvas for rendering
* Vanilla JavaScript for animations and calculations
* CSS for styling and pixel-perfect rendering
* No external dependencies

## Learning Resources

These demos are designed to help you learn about:
* Canvas manipulation
* 3D mathematics and transformations
* Animation techniques
* Color manipulation
* Physics simulations
* Classic demo scene effects

## About Demo Scene

The demo scene was (and still is) a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos - non-interactive audio-visual presentations. The Amiga computer was one of the most popular platforms for demos in the late 1980s and early 1990s, known for its advanced graphics and sound capabilities for its time.

## How to Use

1. Simply open any of the HTML files in a modern web browser
2. No additional libraries or setup required
3. View source code to understand the implementation
4. Modify parameters to experiment with the effects

*Note: These demos are best viewed in a modern web browser with good HTML5 Canvas support.*

## Learning Path

1. **Start with the Basics**:
   - Each effect is commented to explain core concepts
   - Modify simple parameters to see their impact
   - Understand the mathematics behind each effect

2. **Experiment and Improve**:
   - Add new features to the effects
   - Combine multiple effects
   - Optimize the performance

## Going Further

1. **Explore the Original Hardware**:
   - Install an Amiga emulator (UAE recommended) or FS-UAE
   - Learn 68000 Assembly language
   - Study Amiga hardware specifications
   - Study and Experiment with original demo coding
   - Buy a real Amiga :)

2. **Modern Enhancements**:
   - Add WebGL support
   - Implement additional effects
   - Compare hardware vs software rendering approaches

## Development Notes

- Code is intentionally kept simple for educational purposes
- Modern JavaScript features are used for clarity
- Performance optimizations are documented but not always implemented
- Focus is on understanding concepts rather than maximum efficiency
