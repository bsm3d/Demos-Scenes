## About Demo Scene

The demo scene was (and still is) a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos - non-interactive audio-visual presentations. The Amiga computer was one of the most popular platforms for demos in the late 1980s and early 1990s, known for its advanced graphics and sound capabilities for its time.
